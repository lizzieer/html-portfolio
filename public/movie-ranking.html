<h1>The Best Movies of 2023 According To Filiz</h1>
<h2>2023's Hidden- Golden Treasures</h2>
<hr />
<h3> 1.The Lost City</h3>
<p> First of all, it's Sandra Bullock's movie. So how can it be bad? It's already an amazing movie. A very fun romcom with Daniel Radcliffe aka Harry Potter and Brad Fucking Hot Pitt. 10/10</p>
<h3> 2.John Wick 4</h3>
<p> It was a good sequel and it's always a pleasure to watch Keanu Reeves in a fancy black suit. After movie ended, i believed that he's alive. And yes, i'm right! Because John Wick 5 is on the way! BABY.</p>
<h3>3. Saltburn</h3>
<p>It was a really different movie and for the most of the people it was disturbing but it wasn't for me, i enjoyed it! It kinda gived me the MR. Talented Ripley vibes. And Rosamund MOTHER Pike in it. She slayed too much. BLISS, BLISS, BLISS.</p>
